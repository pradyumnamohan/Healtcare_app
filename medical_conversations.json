First, sit down somewhere safe and still, preferably with your head between your knees if that's comfortable.  Take some slow, deep breaths.  Drink some water if you can.  \n\nDoes anything make the dizziness worse or better?  Is it accompanied by any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or difficulty breathing?  \n\nIf the dizziness is severe or doesn't improve at all, or if you have any of those other symptoms, you really need to seek attention promptly.  It's important to get that checked out as soon as you can.",
